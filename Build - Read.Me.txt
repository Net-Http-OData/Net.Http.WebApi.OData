Requirements:
 
  - Visual Studio 2015 or later
  - .NET 4.5 (https://www.microsoft.com/net/targeting)
  - StyleCop version 4.7.54 - ensure that MSBuild integration is selected when installed (http://stylecop.codeplex.com/)
  - Git 2.11.1 (http://git-scm.com/download/win)

If running on a 64 bit machine, run the PowerShell (x86) executable otherwise the StyleCop.targets won't be found.

** By default, the build will run in release mode and run all tests:

	.\build.ps1

** To also build the NuGet package you must specify the version:

	.\build-nuget.ps1 -version X.X.X

** To also push it to NuGet.org after creating the .nupkg you must supply push true:

	.\build-nuget.ps1 -version X.X.X -push $true
