Net.Http.WebApi.OData
=====================

[![NuGet version](https://badge.fury.io/nu/Net.Http.WebApi.OData.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/nu/Net.Http.WebApi.OData)

Net.Http.WebApi.OData is a C# library which parses an OData query uri into an object model which can be used to query custom data sources which are not IQueryable. It was extracted from the [MicroLite.Extensions.WebApi](https://github.com/TrevorPilley/MicroLite.Extensions.WebApi) library into a separate project so that it could be easily used by others.

To use it in your own Web API, firstly install the nuget package `Install-Package Net.Http.WebApi.OData` and then in your controller, define a Get method which accepts a single parameter of ODataQueryOptions:

    public IEnumerable<MyClass> Get(ODataQueryOptions queryOptions)
    {
        // Implement query logic.
    }
